			<h1>Adam's Front End Project!</h1>
		</header>

		<p>These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to
			explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly
			go where no one has gone before. We need to neutralize the homing signal. Each
			unit has total environmental control, gravity, temperature, atmosphere, light,
			in a protective field. Sensors show energy readings in your area. We had a forced
			chamber explosion in the resonator coil. Field strength has increased by 3,000
			percent.</p>

		<p>We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this... Is a remarkable
			piece of bio-electronic engineering by which I see much of the EM spectrum
			ranging from heat and infrared through radio waves, et cetera, and forgive me
			if I've said and listened to this a thousand times. This planet's interior heat
			provides an abundance of geothermal energy. We need to neutralize the homing
			signal.</p>

		<p>Sensors indicate human life forms 30 meters below the planet's surface. Stellar
			flares are increasing in magnitude and frequency. Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar
			006, warp seven. There's no evidence of an advanced communication network. Total
			guidance system failure, with less than 24 hours' reserve power. Shield effectiveness
			has been reduced 12 percent. We have covered the area in a spherical pattern which
			a ship without warp drive could cross in the given time.</p>
